The one big problem I have with this show is the cliches that they use.

And I only have one thing to say to the writers, stop it.

It's cliche after cliche after cliche.

I don't care how long your series is, no matter how many time you've been through it, there will be things that are talked about for a looong time, in the books, but most of the time, it'll be something small and not important.

Sometimes it can actually be more important.

I find this to be true with many series in the Young Adult genre.

Other things that I have noticed: whenever one character has a problem, they all of a sudden get really good about trying to help them, which of course never works.

When a character dies, you cry for a day and then you move on.

They never have a ghost talk to them.

Even if it's ghost in the first person, they can't talk about the feelings they are going through, it has to be through the person.

When someone is traumatized or hurts, they don't say, "I feel pretty okay, I'm going to take a walk now," or "I'm feeling much better now, I'm just going to drink some coffee."

They cry for a little while and then they go on with their lives.
